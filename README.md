Smartthings Device Type for Pioneer VSX 1130/1124 Receivers


This allows you to connect up a VSX-1130 or VSX-1124 (likely others) receiver to smartthings.  The device utilizes a proxy which connects to the receiver via a socket connection.  NOT Tested end to end! (I dont actually own a smartthings hub, waiting on the v2 to come out!)
